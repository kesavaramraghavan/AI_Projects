**Creating AI Projects**

**LLM Mechanics**
I created **LLM Mechanics** as a hands-on space to understand how LLM systems behave in real apps - especially around context windows, token efficiency, and production API reliability so you can design faster, cheaper, and more dependable AI workflows.

Projects included:
- [Context_Limit](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Context_Limit) - explores context window limits and practical handling patterns.
- [Minimal_Token_Count](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Minimal_Token_Count) - techniques to reduce tokens while keeping output quality.
- [Prod-Api-Services](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Prod-Api-Services) - a production-style FastAPI gateway for secure, observable LLM inference.
- [Prod-real-api-metrics](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Prod-real-api-metrics) - monitoring/metrics patterns to track latency, errors, and cost signals.
- [Transcript_CE](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Transcript_CE) - transcript-based experiments for processing and evaluating conversation data.

**Generation Controls (GC)** 
I created **Generation Controls** designed as a hands-on space to understand how to control and optimize LLM outputs in real applications covering temperature, top-p, presence/frequency penalties, stopping criteria, and max token limits so you can generate reliable, safe, and cost-efficient results in production AI systems.

Projects included under examples:
- minimal_demo - explores basic generation with all controls exposed.
- business_json_extraction - demonstrates deterministic extraction of structured outputs from text.
- creative_generation - experiments with high-temperature outputs for ideation and creative tasks.
