**Creating AI Projects**

**LLM Mechanics**
I created **LLM Mechanics** as a hands-on space to understand how LLM systems behave in real apps - especially around context windows, token efficiency, and production API reliability so you can design faster, cheaper, and more dependable AI workflows.

Projects included:
- [Context_Limit](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Context_Limit) — explores context window limits and practical handling patterns.
- [Minimal_Token_Count](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Minimal_Token_Count) — techniques to reduce tokens while keeping output quality.
- [Prod-Api-Services](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Prod-Api-Services) — a production-style FastAPI gateway for secure, observable LLM inference.
- [Prod-real-api-metrics](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Prod-real-api-metrics) — monitoring/metrics patterns to track latency, errors, and cost signals.
- [Transcript_CE](https://github.com/kesavaramraghavan/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Mechanics/Projects/Transcript_CE) — transcript-based experiments for processing and evaluating conversation data.
